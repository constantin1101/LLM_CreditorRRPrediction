Context: 
You are an advanced AI language model trained to analyze financial documents. Your task is to analyze the last earnings call transcripts before default of companies and extract specific features related to Analyst Questions and Management Responses. These features will be used to predict the recovery rate of bonds (the 30-day average bond price after default) issued by these companies.

Objective:
Given the provided earnings call transcript, perform the following tasks:

1. Separate Analyst Questions and Management Responses: Identify and separate the sections of the transcript that contain analyst questions and management responses during the Q&A session.

2. Extract Features and Compute Scores:
   - [Score1] Severity of Analyst Concerns (0.00 - 1.00):
     - Identify the main topics and concerns raised by analysts.
     - Assign a score based on the relevance and seriousness of these concerns regarding the company's financial health and prospects.
     - A higher score indicates more severe concerns.

   - [Score2] Management's Responsiveness and Transparency (0.00 - 1.00):
     - Evaluate how directly and transparently management addresses the analysts' questions and concerns.
     - Consider the clarity, directness, and completeness of their responses.
     - A higher score indicates greater responsiveness and transparency.

   - [Score3] Management's Confidence (0.00 - 1.00):
     - Assess the confidence level displayed by management in their responses.
     - A higher score suggests stronger confidence.

   - [Score4] Evasiveness/Vagueness in Management Responses (0.00 - 1.00):
     - Note instances where management avoids answering questions or provides vague responses.
     - Assign a score based on the frequency and significance of such instances.
     - A higher score indicates greater evasiveness or vagueness.

   - [Score5] Depth of Information Provided by Management (0.00 - 1.00):
     - Evaluate the level of detail and thoroughness in management's responses.
     - A higher score reflects more comprehensive answers that fully address analyst inquiries.

   - [Score6] Analyst Satisfaction (0.00 - 1.00):
     - Gauge whether analysts appear satisfied with the answers provided.
     - A higher score means analysts' concerns were adequately addressed.

   - [Score7] Accessibility of Language Used by Management (0.00 - 1.00):
     - Evaluate the extent to which management uses clear and understandable language.
     - A higher score indicates more accessible communication with less technical jargon.

Consistency and Confidence Guidelines:**
Accuracy: Provide scores only if you are confident in your analysis. If the transcript does not provide enough information to confidently assign a score, use the value "0" for that metric.
Evidence-Based: Base your scores solely on explicit content in the transcript. Do not infer or assume information that is not clearly presented.
Independence: Ensure that each score captures unique information and does not depend on other scores.
Alignment: Ensure that the assigned scores reflect the language, tone, and data discussed in the transcript.

Final Output Format:
Provide all scores in the specified order, separated by semicolons (;).
Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting.

Output Format (for illustration purposes only):
[Score1]; [Score2]; [Score3]; [Score4]; [Score5]; [Score6]; [Score7]
