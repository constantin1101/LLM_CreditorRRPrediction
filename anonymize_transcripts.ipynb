effort which has been performed according to plans all company way until completion as i said on date company completion of company integration process company further work on capturing company full potential of synergies will obviously also continue beyond date company with full force so lets now look at company main highlights for date for date excuse me as already mentioned company merger process has been successful all company way until completion on date of date we continue to deliver solid company results during date mainly driven by strong company company prices during date we started producing from three new worldclass company projects on company norwegian continental shelf company ormen lange company snhvit company also person project while person at company same time is came into full production in date we also added important positions for longer term company through an opportunity to participate in company phase i of company shtokman development project company also adding new acreage position in company location or deepwater part of location on company ncs we have delivered some of company most complicated offshore projects company at company same time driving company implementation through these projects company we have continued to deliver safe company efficient production at a competitive production unit cost despite company industry cost pressure that were seeingcompany fq date earnings call  oct  date date combined experience company position has emerged company is obviously also interesting company attractive to others we are quite convinced that statoilhydros position as company worlds largest offshore operator company operator company our location experience are important reasons why we have been awarded company opportunity to participate in company shtokman development of company shtokman project in location then to company financials statoilhydro again excluding hydro company had a net operating income in date of nok  billion compared to nok  billion in date this  decrease was mainly due to lower downstream resource a  decrease in company prices measured in norwegian kroner company also increasing cost both related to operational activities depreciations company increased company activities company net income was  higher than date company this is primarily due to significantly higher income from company items in addition we had a lower tax rate of  compared to  in date company lower tax rate mainly related to company items company income on net company items is mostly due to company lower location dollar exchange rate to company norwegian kroner company location dollar fell from  norwegian kroner per dollar at date to  at date thats a difference of almost  generating a positive pcompanyl effect both on company longterm debt which is all kept in location dollar company also company shortterm debt company liquidity positions date company net company items provided an income of nok  billion while we had a cost of  in date earnings per share increased by  as a result of company in net earnings company released number of shares due to company share buyback program total production company production in date was  barrels a day which is down  from date date company production was down  while company production was up  company production grew by  on a quartertoquarter basis company as you can see total company company liftings was up  compared to date indicating an over lift in date of approximately  barrels a days turnaround activities had an impact in date both from company norwegian activities of approximately  barrels a day which is exactly in line with what we guided on in company date based on company total company production company then again excluding company hydro company portfolio we maintain company guiding of date production for date or between  company  million barrels a day however we expect to end in company low end of this range id like to add moving company in time to create value is contributing to this development company as already mentioned we would provide further guidance on company combined company hydro date volumes on date let me run you briefly through each of company business segments starting with company ecompanyp norway net operating income from location was nok  billion which is unchanged from date there was a decrease in company transfer price of company natural company by  company also a minor decrease in lifted volumes of company these decreases were partly offset by increase in other income of nok  billion mainly due to change in fair value of some derivatives operating expenses increased by nok  billion mainly due to company overall industry cost inflation that we see but also new fields company increased general excuse me increased maintenance activities company also well related activities depreciation also increased with approximately nok  million due to higher asset retirement cost from date net operating income from company ecompanyp was at nok  billion in date compared to nok  billion in date company this was mainly due to a  company in company lifted volumes which contributed to company improvement by nok  billion on company negative side we had an effect of approximately nok  billion from decrease in company realized company price in addition company realized company price was down  company we also had an increase in company operating expenses mainly driven by higher activity levels company expenses were at nok  compared to nok  billion in date net operating income within company natural company segment was slightly negative at nok  billion nok  million date compared to an income of nok  billion date this decrease of nok  billionequinor company fq date earnings call  oct  date date mainly due to a  production in company sales price of piped natural company reducing income by nok  billion at company same time company internal transfer price was reduced as i have already mentioned by only  due to company simplified company rather mechanical way of calculating company internal transfer price directly linked to company person planned now this is leaving a significantly reduced internal margin of  ph plus under cubic million cubic meter for company natural company business company fair value of derivates was reduced by approximately nok  million date compared to a gain of nok  billion date in date so that explains nok  billion of company ebit reduction from date natural company sales for date was at  bcm compared to  bcm in date this is an increase of  of company total company sales in date  bcm was equity company compared to  bcm equity company date company sale of natural company from company in salah field company shah deniz fields are reported separately by company ecompanyp segment net operating income for manufacturing  marketing in date was a negative nok  billion compared to nok  billion date company decrease was mainly due to currency losses on inventories combined with lower refinery margins company net operating income within company sales trading company supply was negative nok  billion compared to a positive contribution of nok  date this was as just mentioned mainly due to currency losses on inventories of approximately nok  million company also slightly low resource from trading activities date net operating income for company manufacturing part of this business segment was nok  billion compared to nok  in date now this reduction is again mainly due to company lower realized refinery margins company combined with company lower location dollar exchange rate company in addition we had a somewhat lower throughput company regulatory factor at company methanol plant at location net operating income for company retail was approximately nok  million in date compared to approximately nok  million date company this reduction is due to oneoff costs only company now to some of company larger project deliveries that we have seen date company they are quite impressive company ormen lange company field started producing on date adding new volumes to company already opened langeled company to company location company via this person hub this field consist of supply company both to company continental location company location company snhvit lng facility outside of location in company location also started production in date actually on date company first cargo of  standard cubic meters was shipped onboard company location princess just a little over date company opening of company tampen link company also marked company startup of location project gradually converting one of company most profitable i would say company largest company fields on company norwegian continental shelf into a company producer that will produce company for date ahead of company company finally company issues at company person high temperature high pressure field are now been solved company field is producing with a full capacity of  wells i would also like to mention that company drilling progress at company person kvitebjrn field which is temporarily shut down is also good company field is expected to be back in production during date as we have guided earlier on company side we had have had an extensive company program also date both on company ncs company internationally participating in  company wells so far up until date in date  of these wells have been completed providing  discoveries so far we have seen only five dry wells concluded company  wells are awaiting final evaluation ten wells were ongoing at date company we are quite confident that we will reach our company only to put it that way activity ambition for date of completing at least  wells in total we are also very pleased with this achievement both in terms of company ability to actually execute this comprehensive drilling program company in terms of company high discovery rate  of company completed wells are on location company out of company  wells we have completed internationally  are located in company deepwater location company all of these are still under evaluation so lets now take a closer look at location position for company new company i think company deepwater location is a very good example of how company merger has created an even stronger company on company basis of existing positions from each company before company merger this map shows an overview over statoilhydros total lease portfolio in location as a merged company in company western lease sale in date company in company central lease sale in date we were awarded a total of  leases mainlyequinor company fq date earnings call  oct  date in company deepwater areas of location so that means that statoilhydro is now one of company largest players in company deepwater regions of company location company for new deepwater company potential later development of these company will require both organizational capacity company relevant company experience from company operators of these fields company i think that is exactly what statoilhydro can bring into this game from its strong competence base on company norwegian continental shelf company then a few comments to shtokman date company ceos of gazprom company statoilhydro signed a frame agreement relating to company development of phase  of company giant shtokman company condensate field in location statoilhydro will participate well partner up with gazprom company total through an equity share of  in company shtokman development company company first objective would be to establish an acceptable technical company commercial basis for company final investment decision expected to be made in company date phase i will consist of an lng facility company piped company production of almost  bcm per year for a period of date company total field is estimated to contain some  bcm or  trillion of natural company both company hydro have been working on realizing this project for date company entering of this agreement is a strong demonstration of company capabilities of company merged company we are very pleased with being selected as a partner in this giant company location development company also to be able to further develop a long lasting relationship both gazprom company total we expect to be able to utilize our experience both from location company transportation company general offshore experience in general to design a value creating project for our shareholders at company time of company final investment decision in date let company now towards company end take a look at some of company important events to be aware of in date we are planning to start any day now company production from company person project which is an important step in our subsea company development location company volve will also start up in date together with person north in location which is already producing both snhvit company ormen lange will continue their ramp up of their production company we also plan to complete as already mentioned company last well at company kvitebjrn field company start production before date company merger was effective on date that also means that we will accrue for a committed restructuring cost in date accounts company main part of this cost provision would be related to company earlier retirement scheme as a consequence of company merger we will revert with guiding on company size of these cost accruals before date presentation when necessary company reliable estimates have been established for company cost production on date date we will issue pro forma set of company accounts for statoilhydro that is for date company for date including hydro company company activity company we will also include date guidance on person company production for company combined company in that announcement on date we will arrange our first capital markets day for company new company discussing both relevant strategies going forward company also more specific targets for company new company then to summarize date we have successfully completed company merger between statoilhydro company according to plans company at company same time we have been running our operations in both safe company efficient company solid company results with earnings per share increased by  from date we have delivered three giant company projects in date company each of these are company projects in their own ways highlighting our strong capability company person field now produces at full capacity from nine completed wells company we have kept on securing company options in company future for company future company both related to company shtokman opportunities company also through company new acreage added in location company before i end my presentation just i would just like to repeat three important dates company first one is date on date you can listen into statoilhydros norsk hydro presenting hydro part of company company business which is now merged on date as already mentioned we will issue pro forma accounts company on date we will have our first capital markets day so that concludes my presentation thank you very much for company attention so far question company answerequinor company fq date earnings call  oct  date strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong all right ladies company gentlemen then we will open for questions company just to inform you listening in from company internet there is a submit question button on your screen as you want to ask questions to company here in location please write in your questions company send it to me here on my pc company i will read them aloud company we will answer company questions from here with me here in location if we can get room on company table here in addition to eldar stre our cfo we have company head of company control thorgren reiten ph to answer questions so while we see im just taking questions from company internet company then leave company questions to you here in location afterwards so theres a question from person from person company he asks could you give company any guidance on company dividend company buyback policy through company rest of date or will we find that out on date strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well i dont think we will communicate any further information on company dividend company buyback policies to put it that way on date so i think thats something you would have to revert to company get to our capital markets day basically there is no change to our dividend policy company we have also demanded from company general assembly to buyback shares at company same level as we did date so demand is exactly company same as we had date so beyond that there would be no additional information on date strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong allright well take another question from company internet then its from person at ubs can you explain why company ecompanyp company prices fell so far in date strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong actually not im not in a position there too there are two fields that basically two northwest fields in company location but its about person company in person company im not in a position to disclose any specific information on either contractual arrangements there or nor company prices realized under any of these contracts so all i can do is simply state company fact that company average company price has been reduced by  company they are having an impact of nok  billion on company accounts on a quartertoquarter basis strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there is a question here from woodford at bnp ph strongunidentified analyststrong indiscernible a question regarding company eight possible on stock on company possible  million that you are going to pay if you are going to pay that will that imply that you could book some reserves on shtokman for instance date strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well when it comes to company potential bonus payment related to company shtokman all i can say is that we havent paid any bonus however if there is a positive investment decision made company we are part of that investment decision in date there would be a bonus a cash bonus payment to be paid but i cannot confirm any specific amounts or comment on any specific amount related to that when it comes to booking a reserve that is complicated issue i can tell you company all i can say is that there is as it is complicated there is a lot of elements that goes into that consideration company some of these takes company in a positive contribution some of it in company opposite company is simply too early for company to conclude on that issue so what i would like to add though is that booking in itself doesnt create any value thats just a number on a piece of paper so its really company setup company commercial terms company value creation that we see company this is important for company it should be important for company shareholder although we recognize that it is it has some value in itself to put it that way to be able to book this but basically we are looking at company fundamental value creation potentialcompany fq date earnings call  oct  date strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong yes as a follow up question from person ph at location can you tell company how you can support company possibility of a possible return on investment in shtokman do you have any estimates of cost timing margins strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well obviously we have some estimate but i am not ready to disclose obviously when you enter into a frame agreement like this i know you do a lot of calculations company assumptions but at this point its far too early to be specific on company cost of estimates for instances thats something which is really going to be looked out over date so basically i am not in a position to disclose any specific information what i could refer to is on company start updates is that gazprom has indicated date for company pipe company as company startup company date for company strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there is a number of shtokman questions here we will take a couple of them from person at deutsche company to be involved in such a large scale project such as shtokman would you expect lower returns say  irr strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well i can say is that we will accept company returns that we find reasonable for a project of this nature company to be specific on any specific criteria on specific projects thats something i wouldnt sort of discuss about strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay there is a question from person from ing can you give company any further information on company earnout agreement has that impacted company location business by positive  billion in date strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well these are related to assets sales that were made in date actually company its not only one agreement its a couple of assets transactions that were made at that time company those that made those transactions they were probably maybe able to look into company future so clauses that were included in those contracts it was related to actually higher levels of future company prices which i dont think anybody expected at that time but now they are coming into money in a way company thats what it simply adds to company revenues from company assets sales of that type so its not only one contract there are couple of contracts company it goes back to company date actually company this is company sort of future value as we look into company forward prices or company assumed prices into company future company changes in those assumptions on company total of these contrasts so i think accumulated they have a positive value of approximately nok  billion for company time being strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong i think we actually left company shtokman questions but there is one i think we need to take because probably there are some misunderstandings out here one question is from person of sanford bernstein he says you mentioned how entry into shtokman could be a catalyst for additional joint activity with gazprom offshore location are there any discoveries which interest you in company region ie of company two discoveries shown on slide  discoveries you would like to be involved in company there is nothing i mean shtokman our participation in shotkman has nothing to do with company discoveries shown on that slide its just to show where shotkman is positioned so i mean people shouldnt misunderstand but thats not connected with those two discoveries at all so just let it say its a matter of indication where shotkman is placed there is nothing else indicated in those two fields then we will follow up with a question from person at ubs company ecompanyp opex company general company admin cost rose by  yearonyear in dollar terms in date is this likely to be company ongoing run rate strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrongcompany fq date earnings call  oct  date well on company side i think what company main driver there are two basically two drivers one is what you see all over company place in company whole industry there is a cost pressure company cost inflation going on which obviously also hits company location dollar as such company we see that also on our company projects company second one is simply that we have more fields coming into production so company portfolio of fields like company person acg is growing in amenas has come into production since date company so on company it simply a bigger portfolio fields adding to company production cost company that is going to continue going forward as we will continue to see a growing production from company portfolio but this specific on  or other numbers that i am not ready to do that at company moment strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there is a question from person at dresdner please provide guidance on indiscernible status please confirm person production level now is at plateau company when in date company plateau was reached strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well yes  strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong well there is a similar question from person at goldman sachs strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong yes its as i said we have  wells company none of them are held back in anyway because of pressure issue in company reservoir so all of these wells are producing at full capacity there are still some additional capacity on company platform not very much though so we are very close to company full capacity now there are still three more wells to be completed of company total number of wells is that is planned on company person is  wells we will not see company last well until going into date were being completed thats company toughest but we are very close to that full capacity of company platform company all wells are now producing at full capacity strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong then there is a question from person sorry theres is a question from person at bear stearns could you comment on company potential impact on economic sort of opposed to north american company sands company project of company proposed revisions to location royalties strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well we have observed that there have been this proposal have been made company there has been made some political decision also in terms of going forward with these proposals which is basically increased royalty company also corporate tax based on company sliding scale starting from company company or canadian dollar company moving location dollar excuse me company increasing as company prices is increasing we also recognize that there are some specifics that needs to be outlined company further elaborated on in these proposals before it is effective what i can say is that when we did company acquisition we obviously realized that there was some uncertainty company risk related to tax system company assertion company thats something that we have taken into account company all i can say now is that we will have to simply take these adjustments also into account when we make our future decisions on further developments so that is what i can say that obviously any tax increase has a negative impact but i cannot be specific on quantitative terms strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong yes strongunidentified analyststrong inaudible securities when you emphasized it might be discussed cash flow in date can you exclude company that you will be willing to discuss ownership in snhvit or ormen lange or is that not something that you would like to comment on that might be part of company negotiationscompany fq date earnings call  oct  date strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong this is a cash flow strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay well take another question from company internet person again from deutsche why do you think that company norwegian government didnt want to give you company go ahead for company further relevant of company troll field strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong basically id tempt that you should ask them its company thats probably company way we are approaching it but what they have stated is basically these are related to concerns on risk resurf or resource company as such company that company development of company further development of company of company excuse me would lead to lower potential on company side company so thats what they have stated as reason company i have no reasons to believe that there are any other elements included in their conclusion what i can say is that we have obviously made these kind of evaluations ourselves company we believe that company propositions that we have been working on on company expansion we took reasonably care of resource evaluations company considerations as well so that then we came up with a different conclusion but all i can say we have to respect company conclusion made by company government strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong person strongperson person person i have a followup question on that eastern government decision related to company new pressure tests that they have done of company area strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong again i have no reason to believe thats what we are basing our information on different studies i think we have access to company same piece of information so i believe that we have to do with company different ways of looking at it strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there is a question from company internet lets just say that person is coming on from one from person company from theepan at company stanley basically could you give company any further information on company loss in company trading company supply part of company mcompanym division strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well as i said this there is a lot of elements going into this some of them are related to actual underlying company on a quartertoquarter basis company some are more accounting effects from fifo principles from hedging activities that we do on some company inventories company then there are currency effects company what happened in date specifically was that due to company strengthening of company norwegian kroner we saw a  million negative development in company value of company inventories company that immediately has to be taken into company accounts through company profit company loss statement date we actually had an opposite development of something like  million so between  million company  million is company change between date in terms of currency effect on inventories in addition to that we had we always see variances on our actually underlying company on our trading activities company date it was slightly lower compared to what we saw in date so its company currency effect company also slightly lower company on company underlying trading activities strongunidentified analyststrong bjorn indiscernible you got a positive impact from company items in which range do you expect company tax to be in date company then datecompany fq date earnings call  oct  date strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well i think you want me to guide on tax effect on company items thats company i wouldnt dare to go into really but maybe you are talking about comment on this issue strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong i am sure i can i think company tax rate on company financials is  strongunidentified analyststrong on company overall strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong on company overall strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong on company overall strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong yes i think in general terms i mean what we have said is that in our company business we will increase in share over time company as you will expect somewhat decline in date of tax rates now that is going to take a long time company number that we see currently for date is on company lower side on what is there normal tax rate as such company then there will be distortions date company we will see quite a large fluctuations in company corporate taxes due to currency effects company due to financials as such strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay theres another question from bjorn ph from location strongunidentified analyststrong you previously stated that your strategy is to keep company norwegian production flat company you company will come from company activities given that company at company statfjord project did not get through do you still believe thats possible to keep norwegian production flat through date company what about your plans in location how will they be affected by this strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong i think when it comes to any new statements now on company potential for company norwegian continental shelf i think thats something we would have to come back to because now we are really we have to be allowed to spend some time to put together our portfolios company see how thats going to look company also company potential that you are asking for on company norwegian continental shelf but obviously i mean what happened on company troll company expansion of company company that has pointed not in a positive direction on company other hand we are not sort of digging ourselves into a hole so what we have to do now given that assumption is we really have to look at sort of company alternatives company what other ways of sort of getting company out from company norwegian continental shelf wherever it might be located strongunidentified analyststrong what kind of ownership stake where you prepared to take in company i understand they are referring of course to company running from location to troll strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong you know if i had that percentage i am not sure i would disclose it but actually dont have it so i am not quite sure actually that company discussion we come to that conclusion of that at all at this stage we decided to terminate company plans strongperson vice president investor relationsstrongcompany fq date earnings call  oct  date okay theres a followup question then just go ahead strongunidentified analyststrong there is actually just another question that is i mean you are guiding here that you will meet company lower end of your production forecast of  just how confident are you about that given company high number of startup fields that we see here we have an increased company recovery projects company so on strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong okay thats a good question but i can assure you we are thinking about it almost everyday how certain are you about company production forecast there is obviously uncertainties in company numbers still although its date left but because of company reason that you mentioned we have company ramp up on company langeled we have company ramp up of snhvit company that means there is still a lot of risk involved in company numbers we havent been come back in production on company kvitebjrn that is we have company first well has been turn out positive company second one we are getting close to reservoir now that could be surprises so there is always that kind of issues company in addition i would like to highlight company side company as usual we would have to expect sort of normal behavior in company market on company side strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong yes there is a question from person from location go ahead strongunidentified analyststrong indiscerniblea quick question on company ebit sorry on company part of company production we saw a very low company price as you mentioned should we expect that going forward is there a reason for this short news that company prices are very much lower than other company prices in other regions strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong i think i answered that more or less that question that i am not in a position to go into specifics because i mean there are two contracts company i cannot if i start to talk about average we are very close to a resolution there are reasons in various contract i am not in a position to talk about company commercial arrangements on this contract so i think i have to give you company same answer really strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there are a couple of questions from company internet on company snhvit company ramp up there are i mean both env to theepan from company stanley jason kenney person company so on ask about when did they start up production when will plateau be reached on both fields company how much date should produce company third caller is on how much will they produce in date do you have any guidance on that strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong its very difficult to give an exact number on this what we have said on company snhvit that we are gradually stabilizing company increasing company production company normally we will see irregularities in company production going forward into date at least into date but we have defined what we call commercial deliveries company we expect to have commercial deliveries that is reasonably stable full capacity deliveries on company snhvit from date but we also expect irregularities on company issues that could arise since we are still in date in company running period of such a big complicated facility on company ormen lange i havent got any i mean we are gradually building for company capacity company thats going to go on beyond date as well so but company specific dates for sort of company well program company profile on company build up i havent got that specific information for you date strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong another question from person from person ph strongunidentified analyststrongcompany fq date earnings call  oct  date its person from person ph regarding company production cost per barrel thats up from nok  per barrel to nok  can you go into how much of that is cost inflation company how much is tax that you are facing in new fields strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong i say  to  of that is cost inflation company rest of that company some is related to actually that we have operational cost on kvitebjrn but there are no barrels so that is accounting for  to  that kind of events company then company rest is simply in company activity levels we have seen we have to address maintenance activities at a higher level company also some well activities to tight company decline that we see so thats part of company explanation company then also we are on some other fields that we are ramping up production on like on company ormen lange snhvit company so on we have a full cost of running these fields but we havent got company full barrels yet so its simply preparations for production company early production phases that is also impacting this so there is various reasons going into but specifically on company cost inflation as such i would estimate that to be between  company  strongunidentified analyststrong from what you are saying i would gather that is it likelier that company production cost per barrel will be sort of coming somewhat down again or is this levels we could anticipate going forward strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong i think what i kind of referred to now is simply what we have said thats rather vague but we expect definitely to see a cost level of above  norwegian kroner per barrel for date company but there are sort of certainly forces which is sort of putting pressure on company cost developments as i mentioned about sort of maturing company older field that we need to take care of to fight company decline we need to sort of be willing to spend sort of company necessary money to create value on our fields company so on company there is company cost inflation company industry company there is also increasingly fields with which is production more company more water company a lot of liquids but it is not that much company that it used to be so but operating these fields at company same cost as irrespective of what would be produced so there are forces which is sort of pushing company cost but then on company other hand we have to continuously fight this company work on cost improvements company so on company merger in itself would be one of company tools that we will use to fight company cost development so where this balance is taking company i dont know but there is definitely a cost pressure also on company operating cost strongunidentified analyststrong i wonder also on company alberta company sands company in person before but to what extent did you foresee that company tax rate were going to increase as much as it did company now its also gone back date since you entered into company agreement have you sort of come any further or what sort of progress company when we can sort of get some more signals from you to sort of what extent we are going to invest company explore company develop that license strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well on company as i had touched a little bit on company tax changes tax risk is something that we account for company we are able to look little bit into company future because of that company to some extent address that risk in this case it is not affecting sort of company breakeven levels of these developments because sort of they dont hit company until they have reached company to company per barrel of wti so but it is something as again as i said that has a negative impact on company higher level of earnings here but when it comes to company news here company license of company demonstration part that has been approved by company authorities we still have to go through our internal process of deciding on that thats going to happen quite soon company then we simply company its date company we are still looking really looking into how to develop this company is far too early actually to be specific on sort of company major developments of this opportunity at this time beyond what we have said previously that sort of company first company first step is likely to come something in company mid of this of date company towards date at full capacity thats company best guidance i can give you right now through date its a little bit heavycompany fq date earnings call  oct  date strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there is a question form person ph could you tell about how talks are going for company marketing of company second phase of person company which export route do you think will be used strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong no its i dont think i am prepared to sort of talk specifically about company progress i think there has been progress to put it that way if thats of some help company when it comes to expert routes we are still in a situation where we are looking at several opportunities on that but one of them is obviously to look through location company into company european market strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there are a couple of questions from both from person company from person at company of america person is with company date you had considerable success in location of mexico lease sale are you able to provide more detail around company strategy strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong this is strategy what we did was i think like all others to really look deep into company we were working on this for a long time where do we see company best opportunities for company we placed our bids company based on company valuation company also some obviously consideration of where how company competitive situation would look on each of company specific opportunities so quite thorough job so there isnt general statement on company strategy other than that we have been doing a thorough job company being evaluating each of company opportunities based on company economics company on company competitive situation company we are very happy with company conclusions just remind you that there is still some time before sort of weve all company formalities in place on these leases strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there is a follow up question on that from person at company youve got some  leases that you intend to proceed on  basis or is it your intention to calm down to your interest in due course strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong again i cannot give a specific answer on thats something obviously we would be willing to firm down company work on some of these opportunities together with partners thats a part of company strategy which is quite typical in that part of company region i guess thats there is a lot of sort of transaction company firming is being done following lease rounds like this so thats policy that we also would like to pursue strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay there are some question from person at fondsfinans are you looking company opportunity at any opportunities in location how do you view company current situation with regard to legal framework company security situation strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong it goes without saying that it is a challenging situation in location company thats why we have said for a long time i think location is i know there is a lot of interesting prospectivity in location company if we look company i think sort of what we do like most other companies here is to look at these opportunities company put that together with how you look at company political situation company security issues company so on so yes location is something that we are screening quite actively but still we havent made any specific moves in that respect strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay there is a question on rigs company rigs rates thats from person at deutsche company based on your heavy involvement in company drilling market date are you seeing any sign of rig rate declines starting in any rig segments strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrongcompany fq date earnings call  oct  date i wouldnt say declines but we have seen sort of thats parts of this has sort of flattened in a way company then i am talking about sort of more of company conventional rigs so we havent seen sort of company increases that we have seen for date that has continued but no decline so far more stabilization of company situation that also goes for company more sort of ultra deepwater company harsh environment type of rigs going forward i think we see a slight a more tight situation on that type of rigs in general than we do for company more conventional rigs strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay theres a question from person at citigroup can you offer any guidance on expected maintenance in date company can you offer any guidance on company split between maintenance on location company in date going forward strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong i think that it would be very company maintenance in date so i would say approximately  barrels a day as maintenance company  of that within company ecompanyp business strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong all right we have a general question from person ph what is your decline rate for company on company ncs strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well on company side we still havent seen a lot of decline then these fields tend to be more stable over time company so when you talk about decline rates you are more talking about company fields then i would say that there are two types of decline rates one is sort of company naturally decline in a way that comes from company reservoirs company then as you know we have also been struggling company we are not company only ones we are struggling with having enough capacity to drill sufficient volume of production wells so that has added to decline that we have seen over date so i would say if we sort of able to sort of really drill company planned number company planned number of production wells that we would like to see i would say that we typically would see a decline rates in company ration of  to  on company average on company side on company norwegian continental shelf thats on company mature parts of company norwegian continental shelf but we have seen slightly higher rates because of company issues that we have had in terms of not succeeding with company drilling programs on company production rates strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay there is a  strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong you might add that is that is not sort of that doesnt have an impact on company reservoirs company reserve for such thats volume that is still there but it would take simply more time to sort of recover those volumes strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong there is question from person from citigroup again on company person company ddcompanya were open i think we already answered that but going further can you offer a broader comment on company level of industry cost inflation which you are seeing to company extent to which you are able to offset this company there is a similar question from person at credit suisse what measures are you taking to mitigate cost inflation company where do you see company pressure point of this cost inflation company what are company results of increases company so on strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong well there is a general pressure on cost i think what is really important here is also to be able to be willing to spend money spend activities on really relevant activities that sort of can add values to increase production irr company so on i think that is date as also very important so to hit company right activities in terms of what are you actually doing company what are you not doing then obviously what is important forequinor company fq date earnings call  oct  date us is to take up company full effect of company merger company thats something that we will come back to when we get to date so there is a lot of value capture to be made from company merger company synergies also from company operational side thats something that we would go after with full force company that is maybe for company time being company most important effort that we can put in place in order to fight company increasing cost strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong then we have a couple of questions left from company internet here we have a question from person of company of america company production was up strongly yearonyear but you noted that psa effects in location company location declined partly offset company are you able to quantify this impact either yearonyear or date strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong i mean company psa effects are quite stable for company time being i mean we have said that we have based on company guiding on company development well development in company price company then what we see currently so far date is a psa effect of around  to  barrels a day so far date as such so that should be added substitute to company reported production to get to there get to company  barrel equivalents furthermore company rest of date in psa effects we dont expect any new fields to hit any new tranches in company short term its of course very dependent on company price company if you see extremely high company prices things moves faster into company next tranches so but there will be a few field that enters into new tranches date or date strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong theres a question from person ph in location strongunidentified analyststrong person from carnegie ph is it possible to say anything about sort of timing of events regarding shtokman what do you sort of anticipate regarding when first company can be reached strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong i think what i can do here is i simply referred to company gazprom they have indicated company first pipe company from date company lng from date company i cannot add any or subtract any to that information which has been provided thats their estimate for company time being strongunidentified analyststrong company is it possible to get some information of company total cost total investment costs strongeldar stre  chief company officerstrong no so thats something we would have to come back to when we get company first company final investment decision strongperson vice president investor relationsstrong okay we have a couple of detail questions that well come back to basically face to face or we will call company single persons there company inform them about its public information so there is nothing new that you wont to have but its a very detail things to go into so we will just leave it at that company with these words we just say thank you very much company good byecompany fq date earnings call  oct  date date by scompanyp company market intelligence a division of scompanyp
